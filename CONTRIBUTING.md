# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Abstract Folder!

## Pull Requests

**Please do not submit Pull Requests.**

I do not accept unsolicited PRs to keep the review process manageable. The only exception is if I have explicitly labeled an issue with `need-help`.

## Issues

I highly appreciate issue reports. If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to suggest an improvement, please open an issue.

Issues related to **performance** and **security** are especially welcome, particularly concerning:
* Shared Libraries
* Shared Spaces
* Shared Vaults

### Issue Template

When opening an issue, please try to include enough context for me to understand and reproduce the problem. You should attach the **Debug Export** provided by the plugin, as it includes all the necessary environment details. You can get this by going to **Settings -> Debug -> Export**.

You can use this template:

```md
**Description:**
[A clear description of the bug or feature request.]

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**Debug Export:**
[Paste the plugin's debug export here, or drag and drop the file]

**Additional Context:**
[Screenshots, errors, or other relevant info]
```
