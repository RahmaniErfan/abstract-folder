# Abstract Folder

## What it does

Organize your Obsidian vault with virtual folders that don't correspond to the file system.

## Features

*   **Poly-Hierarchical Structure:** Notes can have multiple parents using the `parent` frontmatter setting (default: `parent`).
*   **Ghost Node Display:** The same note appears in all its abstract folders within the plugin's UI.
*   **Folder Note Function:** Any note can act as an abstract "folder" for its children.
*   **Custom Tree & Column Views:** Replaces or augments the native Obsidian file explorer with interactive views.
*   **Frontmatter Moves:** Notes are moved by editing their `parent` property; no file system operations needed.
*   **Right-Click Menu:** Full context menu, with actions like hiding notes, renaming, deleting, and creating new child notes.
*   **Icons:** Supports setting icons.
*   **Parent-Defined Children:** Children can also be listed directly in a parent note's frontmatter.
*   **Conversion Tools:** Tools convert physical folders to abstract folders, and vice-versa (with preview).
*   **Non-Frontmatter File Support:** Supports files without frontmatter (e.g., Excalidraw, Canvas) using parent-defined children.
*   **Dynamic Sorting:** Abstract folders and notes can be sorted by name or modification time.
*   **Settings:** Customizable parent properties, aliases, auto-reveal active file, startup options, view styles, indentation guides, expanded folder memory, and excluded paths.
